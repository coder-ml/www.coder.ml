After high school, he began acting in a variety of television roles, most notably appearing in 1994 on a short-lived Bill Cosby series, The Cosby Mysteries. In 1994 Mos Def formed the rap group Urban Thermo Dynamics with his younger brother and sister, and signed a recording deal with Payday Records that didn't amount to much. In 1996 his solo career was launched with a pair of high-profile guest features on De La Soul's \"Big Brother Beat\" and Da Bush Babees' \"S.O.S.\" A year later, in 1997, Mos Def released his debut single, \"Universal Magnetic,\" on Royalty Records, and it became an underground rap hit. This led to a recording contract with Rawkus Records, which was just getting off the ground at the time, and he began working on a full-length album with like-minded rapper Talib Kweli and producer Hi-Tek. The resulting album, Black Star (1998), became one of the most celebrated rap albums of its time. A year later came Mos Def's solo album, Black on Both Sides, and it inspired further attention and praise. Yet, aside from appearances on the Rawkus compilation series Lyricist Lounge and Soundbombing, no follow-up recordings were forthcoming, as the up-and-coming rapper turned his attention elsewhere, away from music.\n\nDuring the early 2000s, Mos Def acted in several films (Monster's Ball, Bamboozled, Brown Sugar, The Woodsman) and even spent some time on Broadway (the Pulitzer Prize-winning Topdog\/Underdog). He simultaneously worked on the Black Jack Johnson project with several iconic black musicians: keyboardist Bernie Worrell (Parliament\/Funkadelic), guitarist Dr. Know (Bad Brains), drummer Will Calhoun (Living Colour), and bassist Doug Wimbish (the Sugarhill Gang, Grandmaster Flash, Living Colour). This project aimed to reclaim rock music, especially the rap-rock hybrid, from such artists as Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst, who Mos Def openly despised. What made Black Jack Johnson so anticipated though was not so much the supergroup roster of musicians or even Mos Def himself, but rather the lack of black rock bands. Following the demise of Living Colour, there were few, if any, that had attained substantial success. Mos Def hoped to infuse the rock world with his all-black band, and during the early 2000s, he performed several small shows with his band around the New York area. In October 2004, he finally delivered a second solo album, The New Danger, which involved Black Jack Johnson on a few tracks.\n\nTwo years later, after a few more acting roles \u2014 including the Golden Globe-winning Lackawanna Blues and the Emmy-winning Something the Lord Made, both of which were made-for-television movies \u2014 Mos Def released his third solo album, True Magic (2006). A contract-fulfilling release for Geffen, which had absorbed Rawkus years prior, the album trickled out in a small run during the last week of 2006. Bizarrely, the disc came with no artwork and was sold in a clear plastic case \u2014 though its single, \"Undeniable,\" did manage to grab a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Solo Performance. The Ecstatic, released on the Universal-distributed Downtown label, followed in June 2009; at that point, Mos Def had significant acting roles in Michel Gondry's Be Kind Rewind (in which he co-starred with Jack Black) and Cadillac Records (he played Chuck Berry). \n\nExtended & Updated Info:\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mos_def","liveBroadcastContent":"none","publishedAt":"2012-05-04T23:36:36.000Z","tags":["music","hip","hop","hiphop","video","videos","rap","city","real","lyrics","lyricism","lyricist","classic","rapper","rappers","rapping","rappin","battle","battling","mc","emcee","mcs","emcees","freestyle","freestyling","beats","rhymes","rhyme","flow","dj","djs","djing","break","dancing","breakin","dance","b-boy","graffiti","party","slang","underground","street","golden","era","age","1990s","1980s","90s","80s","vintage","bvmtv","yo","yo!","mtv","raps","dope","radio","uncut","mixtape","vinyl","records","turntablist","high","quality","best","hd","hq","oldschool","samples","crew"],"title":"Mos Def - Ms. Fat Booty [Explicit]","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/01yUzXQctcM\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/01yUzXQctcM\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/01yUzXQctcM\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/01yUzXQctcM\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/01yUzXQctcM\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"localized":{"description":"People's Party with Talib Kweli arriving soon!\nA weekly interview show with big-name guests exploring hip-hop, culture, and politics.\n1st episode on Sunday, June 9th at youtube.com\/UPPROXXvideo\n\nFrom 1999 Album: \"Black On Both Sides\"...(Click \"show more\" for artist info)...\n\nBorn Dante Terrell Smith on December 11, 1973, in Brooklyn, NY, Mos Def began rapping at age nine and began professionally acting at age 14, when he appeared in a TV movie.
