Duck Sauce is Armand Van Helden and A-Trak. They met in New York City, make house music and eat Chinese food. In 2010-2011 they literally filled everyone's ears with their smashing hit \"Barbra Streisand\". The song peaked at number one in Belgium, the Netherlands, Poland, Finland, Switzerland, Austria and Norway. It became a Top10 hit in Italy, UK, France, Germany, Ireland and Australia. In 2011, the song received a Nomination in 54th Grammy Awards for Best Dance Recording. It also reached #1 Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart.\nAs you know the duck never stops its quack quack and \"It's You\" is the new single by Duck Sauce. Worldwide promo just started and \"It's You\" gets itself talked about almost everywhere, from the US to Japan. It conquered Europe as well, hitting the dance floors in Belgium, the Netherlands, France and UK. It's a real bomb. Well, we should mention that \"It's You\" is the perfect song for a barber shop. It's the most amazing and suitable soundtrack for a hip haircut, dreadlock, afro head, Mohawk, hair extensions, fluorescent dye or a gorgeous teasing. Duck Sauce combs and brushes us with its new massive single (and video!).\nThe sauce makes the difference. Be sure to dress your music with the best one in circulation.","liveBroadcastContent":"none","publishedAt":"2013-09-10T07:02:02.000Z","tags":["duck sauce","it's you","casablanca","republic","records","dance","ego","hit","top","armand van helden","music summer","bbc radio 1","zane lowe","barbra streisand","atrak","mixmag","radio deejay","zoo di 105","xfactor","cut","buzz chart","music week","new","Armand Van Helden","A-Trak","New York City","#1 Billboard Hot Dance","Best Dance Recording","real bomb","albertino"],"title":"DUCK SAUCE - It's You (Official Video)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8uInyR5KwCY\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8uInyR5KwCY\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8uInyR5KwCY\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8uInyR5KwCY\/sddefault.jpg","width":640}},"localized":{"description":"Duck Sauce - It's You is out now.\nQUACK Album, DOWNLOAD it here: http:\/\/bit.ly\/1rc6zzs\nGrab your copy on iTunes here: http:\/\/bit.ly\/14Lopih\nListen to more songs like this with our playlist!\nApple Music: https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/it\/curator\/ego\/1405705875\nSpotify: http:\/\/spoti.fi\/2qnkdCG\n\nFollow Ego on Facebook:\u00a0http:\/\/www.fb.com\/EgoItaly\nSubscribe to EgoTV NOW:\u00a0http:\/\/bit.ly\/1hzlXkS\n\nDuck sauce is the sweet and sour flavour condiment offered at all Chinese-American restaurants.
