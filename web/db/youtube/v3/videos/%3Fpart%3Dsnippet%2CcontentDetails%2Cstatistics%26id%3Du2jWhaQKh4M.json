I've tried the medication but I don't like relying on it. I've tried changing everything in my life and still can't seem to beat it. It comes and goes but when it comes, it comes. After hearing about Chester Benningtons passing as well as so many other suicide cases recently it inspired me to write about my issues and my everyday battle. I was a huge Linkin Park fan growing up so it felt only right to cover one of their classics in hopes that other people struggling might hear it and relate to it.
