        <p>Garlic. Roasted in olive oil, it can melt in your mouth like butter, while chopped and raw, it can taste pungent and sharp. Either way, this herb-like vegetable offers significant benefits — on the inside and out.</p>
        <p>It’s the organic sulfur compound allicin in garlic that gives it its pungent smell and makes it a healthy addition to your diet.</p>
        <h3>What garlic can do for you</h3>
        <p><strong>1. Boost immunity:</strong> In test tubes, <a href="http://www.clevelandclinicwellness.com/Features/Pages/garlic.aspx">garlic</a> appears to kill cancer cells, and studies involving people show some of the same outcomes. According to the Iowa Women’s Health Study, involving 41,000 middle-aged women, those who routinely ate garlic, fruits and vegetables had a 35 percent lower colon cancer risk. Benefits came from raw and cooked garlic – not supplements.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Work as an anti-inflammatory: </strong><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23057778" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Research</a> has shown that garlic oil works as an anti-inflammatory. So, if you have sore and inflamed joints or muscles, rub them with the oil.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Improve cardiovascular health:</strong> The verdict is still out on whether garlic improves your cholesterol levels, but research does indicate it can have a positive impact on your arteries and 
        <a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/eat-your-way-to-lower-blood-pressure/">blood pressure</a>.</p>
        <p>Investigators believe red blood cells turn the sulfur in garlic into hydrogen sulfide gas that expands our blood vessels, making it easier to regulate blood pressure.</p>
        <p>The German Commission E, similar to the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration, recommends 4 grams of garlic daily – the size of one large clove – to reduce your risk of heart disease.</p>
        <p><strong>4. Give you better hair &amp; skin:</strong> Garlic’s antioxidants and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10594976" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">antibacterial properties</a> can clear up your skin by killing acne-causing bacteria. Some data shows rubbing raw garlic over pimples can clear them away. Be aware, though, that it could cause a burning sensation on your skin.</p>
        <p><strong>5. Protect your food:</strong> Those same antibacterial properties in fresh garlic can kill the bacteria that lead to food poisoning, including salmonella and <em>E.coli</em>. Don’t use garlic as a substitute for proper food sanitation and food handling, though.</p>
        <p><strong>6. Treat athlete’s foot:</strong> Garlic also fights fungus. If you have athlete’s foot, soak your feet in garlic water or rub raw garlic on your feet to attack the itch-causing fungus.</p>
        <h3>Maximize the garlic</h3>
        <p>While you can steep chopped garlic in hot water to make tea, covering the taste with honey, taking advantage of garlic’s benefits is a little complicated. Heating it or putting it in a <a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/recipe-crushed-garlic-bruschetta/">recipe</a> can change its pH balance. The enzymes from the allicin need a few minutes to start working, so let it sit after you mince, crush or chop it.</p>
        <p>You’ll get the most benefit from raw garlic. But if you choose to cook it, don’t heat it above 140°F. Higher temperatures kill the allicin, so add garlic to your recipes when you’re almost done cooking.</p>
        <h3>A few words of caution</h3>
        <p>Garlic’s health benefits are plenty, but don’t add too much to your diet too quickly. Overdoing it can cause discomfort, including upset stomach, bloating, diarrhea, bad breath and body odor.</p>
        <p>You may also get a stinging feeling on the skin if you handle significant amounts of fresh and dried garlic. To avoid garlic-induced skin lesions, wear kitchen gloves.</p>
        <p>On rare occasions, garlic supplements can cause headaches, fatigue, appetite loss, muscle aches, dizziness and allergic reactions such as asthma attacks or skin rashes.</p>
        <p>If you take <a href="http://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs_devices_supplements/hic_Understanding_Coumadin/hic_Anticoagulant_Medication_Warfarin_Coumadin">blood thinners</a>, taking a garlic supplement can increase the medication’s effect, making it even harder for your blood to clot.</p>
